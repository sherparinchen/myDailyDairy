  Ozzy passed away a few days ago. I had listened to some of his legendary tracks over the years, enough to know he was a force, but I was never deep into heavy metal. My tastes lean more toward Rock and Roll: the soaring energy of Guns N Roses, the drama of Queen, the timeless rhythm of The Beatles, and flashes of AC/DC and Pink Floyd scattered in between. Still, something about his passing made me dig into his story. I pulled up old recordings and read fragments of his life.
</p>

<p>
  He came from almost nothing, a poor boy who slipped into petty crime and spent time behind bars as a teen. Later, his battles with addiction became public scars, and his marriage, far from perfect, unraveled in betrayal and chaos. But through all the wreckage, he changed music. He did not just perform; he reshaped sound itself. He became the Dark Prince, not merely a title, but a symbol of an era. I hope he rests, finally, in peace.

  Music has always stirred something in me. There was a time I truly believed I could make a life out of it. But strumming basic chords and half-singing familiar songs is just a shadow of what it takes to be a musician. There is theory, discipline, daily repetition. And time, which always seems to slip through my fingers. <br>For now, music remains a beloved hobby. I want to get better, really better, especially at guitar and drums. I have started with the minor pentatonic scales, slowly hoping to bend them into something expressive. My goal is to play a full solo before the year ends.

  I remember, back in school, watching a senior student perform the <em>Free Bird</em> solo in front of a crowd. For those few minutes, he was not just a student. He was the protagonist of the story, commanding every gaze, every breath. <br>If I were in that same scene, I would be the tree in the background. Still, unnoticed, scenery.
</p>

<p>
  After I passed tenth grade, my uncle gifted me my first guitar. I am left-handed, so I flipped it upside down and quickly realized that everything, from the neck to the bridge, was in the wrong place. It was a plain acoustic, but every time I held it, it felt like it belonged to me. Like I belonged to it.
</p>

<p>
  Then came heartbreak, my first. I withdrew like most broken teenagers do, into anime, into sketchbooks. I barely moved from my bed. One day, my mom snapped. She scolded me, not just for moping, but for drifting through life without ever holding onto anything. <br>Swimming, I had quit. Cycling, I barely tried. The guitar, gathering dust.
</p>

<p>
  Something in her voice struck me. That same evening, I picked up the guitar again. The strings were rusted, the wood dull with neglect. Still, I tried. I did not know what I was doing, but I had an idea. <br>Betrayal. It was a song. I hummed a melody, strummed awkwardly, and wrote down the words. And somehow, it worked. It was raw, but it was real.
</p>

<p>
  That was the moment I understood what creation truly meant. The mind, this strange and infinite space, can make something from nothing. Imagination comes first. Everything else, skill, theory, mastery, they follow. From that point, I started writing songs. A lot of them.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes, I wonder, does hard work really beat talent? Probably yes, if the talented one is complacent. But can it beat someone with both talent and relentless dedication? I doubt it. <br>And to be honest, I have never had much discipline, so I do not get to preach. All I know is this. I love music. I admire Slash, Stevie Ray Vaughan, B.B. King, John Mayer, even Taylor Swift. I want to get better, and slowly, I think I will.
</p>

<p>
  This is not a race. I am not chasing anyone. <br><br>So I will take my time.
