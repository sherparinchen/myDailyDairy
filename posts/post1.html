      <h2>Case Study: My life </h2>
      <p class="date">July 24, 2025</p>
      <p>
        If I had the chance to live another life, I would choose the one where I could see the life I am living right now.
        I just finished reading the book "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. I have mixed feelings about this book. Did I enjoy it? 
        I don't know. I just happened to flip by the pages and it was finished before I could really grasp something out of it. 
        What I do know is that my social perception is as twisted as Merusault. Sure, I would feel a lot of grief if my mother happened
        to die someday unlike him but we are same in few if not many cases. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have lived life the way I wanted and I honestly have no regrets nor do I pity myself for anything I've done. I don't feel 
        great either but nor I am sad about how the pages are folding out each day. I only pursue something if it excites me and most of the time 
        the way I take decisions proportionalizes with how I feel physically. If my body is good, 
        it doesn't really matter to me if the decisions I made were wrong. I can always fix later. And if it can't be fixed, well there is 
        not point dwelling on broken glasses. I'm not sure if its the good way of living life in general but it's my life and I feel comfortable the way
        I am right now. The communists, the extremists, the dogmatics, the lesbians, and the preachers, all are going to die someday. I will die someday too. 
        And we will all be forgotten sooner or later. I don't believe in afterlife and it's okay if people who contradict my thinking have different opinions about it.
        I don't really care if society puts me in a death trial for something I didn't do. I will just think I had been waiting all my life for my execution to happen.
        All I would wish for is to be able to see the glaring faces of people full of hatred towards me to gather on my executing day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Well we don't have executions anymore and I don't live in the Middle East. All I can say is that the irrationality in this life sucks. But it's not a bad life.
        I am plenty happy with my morning coffee, hobbies that I pursue and people I choose to stick with. If life gives you lemonade, make lemons. Season Eight of HIMYM 
        was complete BS. Ted was not supposed to end up with Robin. People should listen to Atta Boy's music while sleeping. Frank Ocean is gay. Stop being depressed listening to Ciggarates After Sex. 
        Lastly, everything I've said here is random. But it's the randomness in life that makes it worth living.
