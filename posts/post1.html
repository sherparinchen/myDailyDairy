      <h2>Case Study: My life </h2>
      <p class="date">July 24, 2025</p>
      <pre>
        If I had the chance to live another life, I would choose the one where I could see the life I am living right now.
        I just finished reading the book "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. I have mixed feelings about this book. Did I enjoy it? 
        I don't know. I just happened to flip by the pages and it was finished before I could really grasp something out of it. 
        What I do know is that my social perception is as twisted as Merusault. Sure, I would feel a lot of grief if my mother happened
        to die someday unlike him but we are same in few if not many cases.
