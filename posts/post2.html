        Ozzy died few days ago. I had listened to few of his iconic songs but I have never been much of a heavy metal fan. I do listen to Rock N' Roll music.
        Guns and Roses, Queen, The Beatles, and some of AC/DC and Pink Floyd and such. But I went to some of his musical records and started learning about his life a little. 
        Oz came from a poor family and he was jailed for petty theft as a teenager. Later, he was battling with substance abuse and he didn't had a perfect marriage either. There were cheating, quarrels and many more. 
        But he revolutionized music. He redefined genres and eventually became the Dark Prince. I hope he rests well.

        I love music. There was a point in my life where I thought I wanted to pursue it as a career but now I realize that playing basic chords and singing
        some songs is far for even the beginning steps for being a musician. There's music theory and daily practice. I can't seem to find time for it so music is better
        off as a hobby for me. I do have a strong interest in improving my guitar and drums skills. I want to first start with getting used to the minor pentatonic scales.
        I wish to be able to play solos by the end of this year. When I was in my school, I once heard a senior student playing Free Bird's solo in front of everyone. 
        It was as if he is the main character and if I had to put myself in some position, I would probably be the tree on the background of a movie scene.

    I wanted to be like him. When I finished my tenth grade. I got my first guitar as a present from my uncle. I am left handed so I had to make it upside down and later realized that
    my bridge position and neck needed some work. It was a simple acoustic guitar but I felt like I was meant to be a musician everytime I picked it up. 
    I had my first heartbreak soon after that so as a lousy teenager, I spent most of my days watching anime and drawing. It was my another hobby. 
    One day, my mom scolded me for bedrotting myself. She said that it was always like that; I never had much passion for anything. I had a swimming membership but I soon lost interest. 
    My uncle got me a bicycle but I never rode it. I had a guitar but I didn't practice enough. After hearing her lecture, I got up and picked up my guitar. The strings were rusty
    and it was covered with dusts from times my room was cleaned. I tried to first think about writing a song. I had a topic. Betrayal. Soon, I would be strumming some random
    chord patterns and I had my lyrics finished. It sounded good to be honest. When I sang the song for a couple of times, I realized something. People can really create. The power of
    imagination might be the best trait passed upon us. Knowledge, mastery, and everything else came after imagination. And thus, I began to write a lot of songs.

        What do you think: Does hardwork beat talent? Sure, if a person is dedicated enough, he would probably surpass another guy with talent but is lazy. But does he ever has a 
        chance against a talent with the same dedication and passion who puts the same amount of hardwork? Well I was lazy and I never had much dedication to begin with so I don't 
        even have the right to debate on this topic. What I do know is that I love music. I love Slash, SRV, BBKing, John Mayer, and even Taylor Swift. I want to improve my music skills 
        and slowly I probably will. I am not competing against anyone so I will take as much time as I need.
